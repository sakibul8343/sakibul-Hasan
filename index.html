                     <p>The world is in the midst of a mass extinction crisis, losing species at 1,000 times the natural background rate. As a result of human population growth and ever-increasing consumption, threatened and endangered species are facing habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and climate disruption.

Every year, the world’s increasing population adds about 37 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These emissions come from industry, agriculture, forestry, utilities, and transportation. Importantly, deforestation — of which the burning of tropical forests is the major component. In fact, deforestation contributes about 10% of these emissions. In addition, it is also the principal driver of biodiversity loss.

Our unrelenting carbon dioxide emissions have surpassed the planet’s ability to absorb these greenhouse gases. With this imbalance, we now face climate disruption and species extinctions.  Even under the most optimistic scenarios, we aren’t going to reduce the high levels of carbon dioxide anytime soon.

While governments struggle with finding solutions, species are seeking higher ground with habitable temperatures for their survival.  In addition, communities are facing floods, landslides, droughts, and other environmental consequences. Overall, the planet is losing resilience.</p>
